A `.conf` file for [lirc](http://lirc.org) for an old universal remote:

### Requirements

You should have a working instance of LIRC, receiver. etc. Please refer to
one of the several guides elsewhere online.


### Usage

First, configure the remote to send MCE signal codes. You can use either
profile button: <kbd>VCR</kbd> or <kbd>SAT</kbd>.

1. Press and hold <kbd>SETUP</kbd> until the red light remains lit.
2. Press the desired profile button (<kbd>VCR</kbd> or <kbd>SAT</kbd>);
   the red light should blink once.
3. Type in the code for MCE: <kbd>1</kbd><kbd>6</kbd><kbd>1</kbd><kbd>1</kbd>;
   the red light should blink after each digit then turn off.

Next, install the provided configuration file into `/etc/lirc`:
```
# sudo cp philips-sru3004wm17.conf /etc/lirc/
```

At this point, you should probably use your system's graphical interface to
enable this keymap:

* For Kodi/OSMC, try navigating into `My OSMC > Remotes'
* To enable it manually, copy the conf file as `/etc/lirc/lircd.conf`
